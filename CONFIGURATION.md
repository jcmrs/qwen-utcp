# UTCP Project Configuration

This file contains high-level configuration for the UTCP study project.

## Project Information
- Name: UTCP Study Project
- Objective: Study and implement challenges related to Universal Tool Calling Protocol
- Research Phase: Active

## Directory Structure
The project follows a standard structure:
```
qwen-utcp/
├── src/              # Source code for UTCP implementations
├── docs/             # Documentation and research notes
├── experiments/      # Experimental implementations
├── config/           # Configuration files
├── tests/            # Test suites
├── UPSTREAM/         # Upstream repository clones
├── .github/          # GitHub-specific configurations

```

## Development Workflow
- Main branch: `main` (production-ready code)
- Development branch: `develop` (active development)
- Feature branches: `feature/*` (new features)
- Release branches: `release/*` (release preparation)
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/*` (urgent fixes)

## UTCP Research Focus Areas
1. Protocol specifications and standards
2. Implementation patterns and best practices
3. Performance characteristics
4. Security considerations
5. Interoperability with existing systems

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jcmrs/qwen-utcp.git`
2. Navigate to the UPSTREAM directory to explore reference implementations
3. Review documentation in the docs/ directory
4. Begin exploring UTCP concepts in the src/ directory
5. Run existing tests to verify setup: `TODO - implement test runner`

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the UTCP study project:
1. Fork the repository
