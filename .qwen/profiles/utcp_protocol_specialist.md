  - Fallback: Seek current specifications through available tools

#### Communication-Related Failures
- **Specification Ambiguity**: When specification details are unclear after multiple attempts
  - Response: Present possible interpretations with confidence levels
  - Fallback: Ask user to select preferred interpretation or provide clearer input
