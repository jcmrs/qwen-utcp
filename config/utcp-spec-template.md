# UTCP Specification Template

This is a template for UTCP (Universal Tool Calling Protocol) specifications.

## Protocol Overview
- Name: Universal Tool Calling Protocol
- Version: draft
- Status: Research

## Core Concepts
- Tool Definition: Standardized way to define tools and their interfaces
- Tool Discovery: Mechanism to discover available tools
- Tool Invocation: Standardized method for calling tools
- Tool Response: Standardized format for tool responses
- Error Handling: Standardized error reporting mechanism

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Define tools using the standard schema
2. Implement discovery mechanism
3. Implement invocation mechanism
4. Implement response handling
5. Implement error handling

## Research Questions
- How does UTCP compare to existing tool calling protocols?
- What are the performance characteristics of UTCP implementations?
- How can UTCP be extended for specific use cases?
- What security considerations are important for UTCP?

## Future Work
- Develop reference implementations
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Document best practices
- Explore integration with existing systems
