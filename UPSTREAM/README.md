# UPSTREAM Directory Management

This directory contains upstream clones of remote repositories for study, analysis, inspection, examination, learning, and documentation of UTCP-related projects.

## Purpose
- Clone and maintain copies of upstream UTCP-related repositories
- Allow for safe experimentation without affecting original repositories
- Enable comparative analysis between different implementations
- Facilitate learning from existing implementations

## Management Script
Use the provided `manage_upstream.py` script to:
- Clone new upstream repositories
- Update existing upstream clones
- Compare changes between upstream and local modifications
- Document differences and findings

## Best Practices
- Keep upstream clones read-only to prevent accidental modifications
- Document any changes made to upstream code for research purposes
- Regularly update upstream clones to track the latest developments
- Use separate branches for any experimental modifications
